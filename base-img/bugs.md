##Fix ip range:
vi /etc/vbox/networks.conf

##After adding longhorn install script:
Current machine states:

default                   aborted (virtualbox)

The VM is in an aborted state. This means that it was abruptly
stopped without properly closing the session. Run `vagrant up`
to resume this virtual machine. If any problems persist, you may
have to destroy and restart the virtual machine.
